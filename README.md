# Data Science Notebooks

Welcome to my data science notebook collection. This repository gathers a variety of Python notebooks showcasing practical applications of data science, NLP, machine learning, and data analysis â€” many of which draw from real-world challenges in public sector audits, legal document analysis, and financial risk assessment.
